# Simple Load-Test Suite for Posters
A simple load test suite for [Posters](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store) to demo [XLT](https://github.com/Xceptance/XLT) features and functionalities. Currently this test suite works against [Posters 2.1.1](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store/releases/tag/2.1.1).

The test suite is ready to be executed against the Posters demo store [Posters](https://posters.xceptance.io:8443/). Please note, this setup is for testing purposes only and does not handle a lot of load. Please setup your [own copy of the Posters demo store](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-demo-store) if you want to experiment with executions of higher load factors and more complex test configurations.

## Advanced
Please also take a closer look at the [Advanced Posters Test Suite](https://github.com/Xceptance/posters-advanced-loadtest-suite), which uses extended concepts to make the entire setup easier and more flexible. It also brings simpler property handling to parametrize tests and demonstrate more reuse and page-concept like approach.
